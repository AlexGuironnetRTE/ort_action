## Code in Main

This tool relies on the availability of `Node.js`. Please check if you have `Node.js` and the related package manager
`npm` available on your system and verify that the version of `Node.js` is at least `14`.

```bash
$ node --version
v14.17.0
$ npm --version
6.14.13
```

`Node.js` and `npm` can be downloaded in one package from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/). And here are
[instructions for upgrading `Node.js`](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/update-node-js-version#ftoc-heading-3).

Install the dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution
```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:
```bash
$ npm test

 PASS  ./index.test.js
  ✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
  ✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
  ✓ test runs (95ms)

...
```


# Run the analysis

The tool will analyze the license dependencies in predefined Github repositories and store reports of the analyses
in the files `out/<organization>/<repository>/analyzer-result.xml`

```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm run package
node dist/index.js
```


## Change action.yml

The action.yml contains defines the inputs and output for your action.

Update the action.yml with your name, description, inputs and outputs for your action.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Change the Code

Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

```javascript
import * as core from '@actions/core';
...

async function run() {
  try {
      ...
  }
  catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run()
```

See the [toolkit documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages) for the various packages.

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:
```bash
$ npm run package
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```

Note: We recommend using the `--license` option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.

Your action is now published! :rocket:

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Validate

You can now validate the action by referencing `./` in a workflow in your repo (see [test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml))

```yaml
uses: ./
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
```

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/actions) for runs of this action! :rocket:

## Usage:

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and latest V1 action
